# Add Section functionality to Nextcloud Forms

## Description

This PR adds a new "Section" element type to Nextcloud Forms that acts as a visual separator to group fields logically, without affecting data storage, validation, or submission logic.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Section Creation
- New "Section" element type in the form editor
- Only parameter: section name (title) visible to users

### 2. Editor Display
- Sections appear as non-input elements
- Draggable for reordering
- Title displayed in bold/visually distinct style
- No description field for sections
- Bottom separator line for visual distinction

### 3. Form Filling Display
- Sections display as headings/subheadings at their position
- No influence on validation, mandatory fields, or submission flow

### 4. Export/View Responses Behavior
- Sections do not affect CSV export or response viewing
- Not stored in user responses

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### Constants and Types
- **`lib/Constants.php`**: Added `ANSWER_TYPE_SECTION = 'section'` constant
- **`lib/ResponseDefinitions.php`**: Updated `FormsQuestionType` to include `"section"`

#### API Controller (`lib/Controller/ApiController.php`)
- **Section Validation**: Sections cannot be required, have options, or file uploads
- **Answer Storage**: Sections are filtered out from answer storage
- **Export Filtering**: Sections are excluded from submissions export
- **Form Cloning**: Sections maintain `isRequired = false` when cloning forms

#### Submission Service (`lib/Service/SubmissionService.php`)
- **Export Data**: Sections are filtered out from CSV/Excel export data
- **Validation**: Sections are ignored during submission validation

### Frontend Changes

#### Components
- **`src/components/Questions/QuestionSection.vue`**: New component for section rendering
- **`src/components/Questions/Question.vue`**: Updated to support section display and editing
- **`src/models/AnswerTypes.js`**: Added section type with appropriate icon and labels
- **`src/models/Constants.ts`**: Added `ANSWER_TYPE_SECTION` constant

#### Views
- **`src/views/Create.vue`**: Updated to pass question type to components
- **`src/views/Submit.vue`**: Updated to filter sections from validation and storage
- **`src/components/Results/ResultsSummary.vue`**: Updated to handle sections in results display
- **`src/components/Results/Submission.vue`**: Updated to filter sections from submission data

## Testing

### Backend Tests

#### ApiControllerTest.php
- `testUpdateQuestion_sectionCannotBeRequired()`: Verifies sections cannot be made required
- `testNewOption_sectionCannotHaveOptions()`: Verifies sections cannot have options
- `testUploadFiles_sectionCannotHaveFileUploads()`: Verifies sections cannot have file uploads
- `testGetSubmissions_sectionsAreFilteredOut()`: Verifies sections are filtered from export
- `testNewSubmission_sectionsAreNotStored()`: Verifies sections are not stored in answers

#### SubmissionServiceTest.php
- `testGetSubmissionsData_sectionsAreFilteredOut()`: Verifies sections are filtered from export data
- `testValidateSubmission_sectionsAreIgnored()`: Verifies sections are ignored in validation
- `testValidateSubmission_sectionsCannotBeRequired()`: Verifies sections cannot be required in validation

## Files Changed

## Screenshots

### Before
- No section functionality available

### After
- Section element available in form editor
- Sections display as visual separators with titles
- Sections can be reordered like other form elements
- Sections do not appear in form submissions or exports

## Breaking Changes
None. This is a purely additive feature that does not affect existing functionality.

## Notes to Reviewers

- All hardcoded string literals have been replaced with constants (`Constants::ANSWER_TYPE_SECTION` on backend, `ANSWER_TYPE_SECTION` on frontend)
- Sections are completely filtered out from data storage and export to ensure they don't affect existing functionality
- Comprehensive test coverage has been added for all section-related functionality
- The implementation follows Nextcloud Forms coding standards and patterns
