- **📝 Simple design:** No mass of options, only the essentials. Works well on mobile of course.
- **📊 View & export results:** Results are visualized and can also be exported as CSV in the same format used by Google Forms.
- **🔒 Data under your control!** Unlike in Google Forms, Typeform, Doodle and others, the survey info and responses are kept private on your instance.
- **🙋 Get involved!** We have lots of stuff planned like more question types, collaboration on forms, [and much more](https://github.com/nextcloud/forms/milestones)!

## Webhook support

See the [Nextcloud Server Administration Guide](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/admin_manual/webhook_listeners/index.html#forms-app-events) to find information on which Forms events are available to be used with webhooks and how to configure them.

## 🏗 Development setup

1. ☁ Clone this app into the `apps` folder of your Nextcloud: `git clone https://github.com/nextcloud/forms.git`
2. 👩‍💻 In the folder of the app, run the command `composer i && composer i && npm ci && npm run build` to install dependencies and build the Javascript.
3. ✅ Enable the app through the app management of your Nextcloud
4. 🎉 Partytime! Help fix [some issues](https://github.com/nextcloud/forms/issues) and [review pull requests](https://github.com/nextcloud/forms/pulls) 👍

### 🧙 Advanced development stuff

To build the Javascript whenever you make changes, you can use `npm run build`. Or `npm run watch` to automatically rebuild on every file save.

You run several tests by:

- `npm run lint` for JavaScript linting
- `npm run stylelint` for CSS linting
- `composer cs:check` for the Nextcloud php coding standard
- `composer lint` for php linting
- `composer test:unit` and `composer test:integration` to run the php functionality tests
- `composer psalm` for static code analysis
